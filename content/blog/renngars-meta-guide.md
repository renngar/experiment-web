  Alexi Cir'Tein was a high ranking Stormcloak officer, but was captured shortly
  before Ulfric and is being kept in the cells below Helgen Keep awaiting
  interrogation. Well known on the battlefield for her unique fighting style as
  well as her mystic blades which are storied to have been forged from the souls
  of dragons in the days of old, she would make a glad ally to whomever would
  free her.

# Major changes

## — Changelog here —

Updated for the latest version. The guide now runs with Skyrim SE 1.5.80 and SKSE64 2.0.16, the newest round of Creation Club updates. All included mods were updated quickly, thankfully, and you can now safely update your own setup. I added a Resource page to help you with that here.

New perk overhaul. After running with Vanilla perks for a long time (which I personally still prefer over everything else), we have now integrated EnaiSiaion’s recently released vanilla-plus perk overhaul Vokrii as a new required mod for the Gameplay module.

New weather / lighting overhaul combination. After switching over to Cathedral Landscapes with the previous update, I have now also replaced Obsidian Weathers with Cathedral Weathers. To match the new weather overhaul, I have also swapped out ELFX for Luminosity + Relighting Skyrim for a much simpler option that is less prone to flickering and does not rely on custom meshes.

Various guide flow improvements. All Finalisation pages were split up into multiple steps. Instructions previously “outsourced” to Resources pages are now back in the main guide. ESL-ifying plugins is no longer optional but was moved to the very end of each module to be done in one go which should speed up the process considerably.

Created New Game page. This has been on my list for over a year and I finally got around to it. The page is intended to help you along when starting an actual new playthrough and includes some preparation instructions as well as mod configuration tips and notes. Will be expanded in the future.
