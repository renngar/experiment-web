# Benefits of Netlify CMS, GitHub, and Netlify Workflow

Congrats! Now that Netlify CMS is successfully configured to your project, every time you add a new post, the content will be stored in your repository and versioned on GitHub because Netlify CMS is Git-based. Also, thanks to Netlifyâ€™s Continuous Deployment, a new version will be deployed every time you add or edit a post.
